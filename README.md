# Spatial_Transform_Network

I made STN by using Low level Tensorflow api because the network needs initial value for theta.

Here is the output.

I test my network in rotated image and translated image.
The upper one is the output in rotated image. And the lower one is the output in translted image.
To train my network in rotated image, I made file that rotate input image randomly.

To train my network in translated image, I made file that translate input image randomly
